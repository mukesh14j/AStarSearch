Sanjana is a lecturer working in a university at Bangalore. Due to Covid pandemic, she is
handling online classes from her native place, Mumbai. Since the situation is under control, the
government has removed the lockdown restrictions. The University management issued a
circular stating that all the lecturers has to handle the classes from the University. Now, she
needs to come back to the University.

However, due to a mass movement of public, all flights from Mumbai have been booked and
she is left with the only option of road transport. Matters have been further complicated by
some technical issue with Google maps making them unavailable for the time being.
Help her using your knowledge of informed search strategies. Create a search agent to find the
most optimal path to reach Bangalore. Below is a map of road connectivity between various
cities.
